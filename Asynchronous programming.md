# Asynchronous programming

Here's a detailed explanation of **Asynchronous Programming** in a .NET Core Web API, focusing on the latest versions (e.g., .NET 6, 7, or 8 as of February 27, 2025). I'll expand on **why** it improves scalability and **how** to implement it using `async`/`await` patterns, especially for I/O-bound operations, with examples and advanced insights.

### What is Asynchronous Programming?

Asynchronous programming allows a program to perform tasks without blocking the calling thread. In the context of a Web API, it means handling requests in a non-blocking manner, freeing up threads to process other requests while waiting for I/O operations (e.g., database queries, HTTP calls, file I/O) to complete.

- **Synchronous**: The thread waits for the operation to finish before moving on.
- **Asynchronous**: The thread initiates the operation and continues with other work, resuming when the operation completes.

---

### Why Use Asynchronous Programming?

#### Improves Scalability
- **Thread Efficiency**: In a Web API, requests are handled by threads from a thread pool. Synchronous I/O operations (e.g., waiting for a database query) block these threads, reducing the number available for other requests. Asynchronous operations release the thread back to the pool during I/O waits, allowing the server to handle more concurrent requests.
- **Resource Utilization**: By not tying up threads, the API can scale better under load, especially in high-traffic scenarios or when dealing with slow external services.
- **Responsiveness**: Reduces latency for clients by processing more requests in parallel.

#### Real-World Impact
- A synchronous API handling 100 simultaneous database queries might exhaust the thread pool (e.g., 50 threads), rejecting new requests. An asynchronous API can initiate all 100 queries and reuse threads, avoiding bottlenecks.

### How to Implement Asynchronous Programming

The `async`/`await` pattern in C# simplifies asynchronous programming by making it look synchronous while handling the complexity under the hood.

#### Step 1: Basic Setup
In .NET 8 Web API (minimal hosting model):

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddControllers();
builder.Services.AddHttpClient(); // For async HTTP calls

var app = builder.Build();
app.UseRouting();
app.UseAuthorization();
app.MapControllers();
app.Run();
```

#### Step 2: Async Controller Example
Here’s a controller with asynchronous I/O operations:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using System.Net.Http;

namespace MyWebApi.Controllers
{
    [ApiController]
    [Route("[controller]")]
    public class WeatherController : ControllerBase
    {
        private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;

        public WeatherController(IHttpClientFactory httpClientFactory)
        {
            _httpClient = httpClientFactory.CreateClient();
        }

        [HttpGet]
        public async Task<IActionResult> GetWeatherAsync()
        {
            try
            {
                // Async HTTP call to an external weather API
                var response = await _httpClient.GetStringAsync("https://api.weather.example.com/data");

                // Simulate additional async work (e.g., DB call)
                await Task.Delay(100); // Placeholder for I/O

                return Ok(new { Data = response });
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                return StatusCode(500, $"Error: {ex.Message}");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- **Explanation**:
  - **`async Task<IActionResult>`**: Marks the method as asynchronous, returning a `Task` that represents the operation.
  - **`await`**: Pauses execution until the I/O completes, but frees the thread to handle other requests.
  - **`GetStringAsync`**: An async method from `HttpClient`, non-blocking.
  - **`Task.Delay`**: Simulates another async I/O operation.

#### Step 3: Test the API
- **Request**: `GET /weather`
- **Behavior**: While the external API call and delay execute, the thread isn’t blocked, allowing the server to process other requests concurrently.

---

### How It Works Under the Hood

1. **Thread Pool**: When a request hits the API, a thread from the pool starts executing `GetWeatherAsync`.
2. **Await**: At `await _httpClient.GetStringAsync`, the thread registers a callback and returns to the pool, freeing it for other tasks.
3. **Completion**: When the HTTP response arrives, a thread (not necessarily the same one) resumes execution from the `await` point.
4. **Scalability**: With many requests, threads are reused efficiently, avoiding exhaustion.

---

### Advanced Asynchronous Programming

#### 1. **ConfigureAwait(false)**
Optimize performance in library code:

```csharp
[HttpGet("optimized")]
public async Task<IActionResult> GetWeatherOptimizedAsync()
{
    var response = await _httpClient.GetStringAsync("https://api.weather.example.com/data")
        .ConfigureAwait(false); // No need to resume on original context
    return Ok(new { Data = response });
}
```

- **Why**: By default, `await` resumes on the original synchronization context (e.g., ASP.NET’s request context). `ConfigureAwait(false)` skips this, reducing overhead in non-UI scenarios like Web APIs.

#### 2. **ValueTask for Lightweight Operations**
Reduce allocations for simple async operations:

```csharp
[HttpGet("lightweight")]
public ValueTask<IActionResult> GetWeatherLightweightAsync()
{
    if (DateTime.Now.Second % 2 == 0) // Simulate condition
    {
        return new ValueTask<IActionResult>(Ok(new { Temperature = 25 }));
    }

    return new ValueTask<IActionResult>(Task.FromResult<IActionResult>(Ok(new { Temperature = 26 })));
}
```

- **Explanation**: `ValueTask` avoids `Task` allocation when the result is immediately available, improving memory efficiency.

#### 3. **Parallel Async Operations**
Handle multiple I/O tasks concurrently:

```csharp
[HttpGet("multi")]
public async Task<IActionResult> GetMultipleWeatherAsync()
{
    var tasks = new[]
    {
        _httpClient.GetStringAsync("https://api.weather.example.com/data1"),
        _httpClient.GetStringAsync("https://api.weather.example.com/data2")
    };

    var results = await Task.WhenAll(tasks);
    return Ok(new { Weather1 = results[0], Weather2 = results[1] });
}
```

- **Explanation**: `Task.WhenAll` runs tasks in parallel, reducing total wait time.

#### 4. **Cancellation**
Support request cancellation:

```csharp
[HttpGet("cancellable")]
public async Task<IActionResult> GetWeatherCancellableAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    await Task.Delay(5000, cancellationToken); // Simulate long-running I/O
    return Ok(new { Temperature = 25 });
}
```

- **Explanation**: The `CancellationToken` is passed automatically by ASP.NET Core and cancels the operation if the client disconnects.

### Best Practices

1. **Always Use Async for I/O**: Database calls (`ToListAsync`), HTTP requests (`GetAsync`), file I/O (`ReadAsync`), etc., should always be async.
2. **Avoid Blocking**: Never use `.Result` or `.Wait()`—they defeat the purpose of async and can deadlock:
   ```csharp
   // BAD
   var result = GetWeatherAsync().Result;

   // GOOD
   var result = await GetWeatherAsync();
   ```
3. **Profile Async Overhead**: For CPU-bound work, async might add overhead; use synchronous methods instead.
4. **Handle Exceptions**: Always wrap async calls in try-catch to manage failures gracefully.
5. **Scale Testing**: Test under load (e.g., with tools like Apache Bench) to verify scalability gains.

---

### Real-World Scenario
Imagine an e-commerce API:
- **Product Search**: Async DB query (`ToListAsync`) and external inventory API call (`GetAsync`).
- **Order Processing**: Parallel async calls to payment and shipping services (`Task.WhenAll`).
- **Status Check**: Lightweight `ValueTask` for quick status responses.

Sample optimized endpoint:
```csharp
[HttpGet("products")]
public async Task<IActionResult> GetProductsAsync([FromServices] DbContext db, HttpClient client)
{
    var dbTask = db.Products.AsNoTracking().ToListAsync();
    var apiTask = client.GetStringAsync("https://inventory.example.com");

    await Task.WhenAll(dbTask, apiTask);
    return Ok(new { DbProducts = dbTask.Result, ApiData = apiTask.Result });
}
```

- **Scalability**: Handles hundreds of requests without thread exhaustion.

---

### Why It Improves Scalability (Detailed)
- **Thread Pool Limits**: A typical thread pool has ~1000 threads. Blocking 1000 DB queries exhausts it, rejecting new requests. Async frees threads during waits, potentially handling thousands of concurrent requests with the same pool.
- **I/O Bound**: Web APIs are typically I/O-bound (waiting for DB, network), not CPU-bound, making async ideal.
